    "# Modifiying Network Flow Algebra for Modelling Non-point Pollution for Interactive Use in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is related to the nitrogen modeling case study paper by Shook, Merson, and Wentz: \"Network Flow Algebra for Modelling Non-Point Source Pollution: A Case Study in Niantic Watershed, Connecticut\" (2018, in review). Their method of non-point pollution nitrogen modeling utilized network flow algebra to create a more efficient modeling techniqe that only counts the net flow path from the nitrogen source to sink. Their method of reach reduction allows the program to not have to calculate from the pollution source, to non-source, to sink. Our goal is to use a Jupyter Notebook to add widgets that allow users to modify the input data and receive a shapefile of flow paths with accumulated nitrogen flow attributed. In the original work, the nitrogen load values are set in the stream flow shapefile based on land use NLCD values. For our modification of the original code, the user will be able to use a sliding scale widget to decide how much nitrogen (or other pollutant, potentially) will be associated with land use types that are sources for non-point pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a generalized, widely applicable workflow, the Jupyter Notebook uses two slider bars, each with a range of values representing a land use value of \"Cultivated Crops\" (30 - 50 N/acre/year) or \"Developed Land\" (40 - 60 N/acre/year). NLCD values of (22) Developed (Low Intensity), (23) Developed (Medium Intensity), and (82) Cultivated Crops are used to define Cultivated Crops and Developed Land. As the slider is changed for a given land use value, that value will be applied to the stream flow direction network; that is, in a given cell of the NLCD dataset, whatever segment of streamline passes through that cell will be attributed with the land use value. The flow direction network will then be passed into the existing code to calculate the output nitrogen load, creating a shapefile that includes the stream flow network attributed with nitrogen values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project took many forms over the course of the semester. Initially, we tried to create the goal of the project using a new study area, the Lake Superior-North watershed, HUC 04010101. We obtained data from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) for surface water pollution by watershed based on the USGS HUD categorization to use as validation for Nitrogen surface water pollution. We also obtained a 30 m Land Use NLCD raster from Data.gov and clipped to our study watershed and stream flow direction for 30 m DEM from Data.gov and clipped to our watershed."

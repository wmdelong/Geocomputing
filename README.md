-DeLong_Rosengren_Strug_FinalProject.ipynb
This project was completed by Whitney DeLong, Lauren Strug, and Elise Rosengren as a class project for GEOG 5541. It should be noted that, although the title implies that we determined something about landslide susceptibility, what we actually did was create raster datasets from a lidar-derived DEM to be used to attempt to determine something about landslide risk.
